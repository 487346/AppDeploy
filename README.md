Age & Gender Prediction from Facial Images: A Bias-Aware Deep Learning Approach for Personalized User Experiences
Age and gender prediction from facial images is widely used in areas such as personalized marketing, security, and healthcare. However, current models suffer from:

Bias in datasets: Most datasets are dominated by certain demographics, leading to unfair predictions.

Inaccuracies in real-world applications: Deep learning models struggle with varying lighting, angles, and ethnic diversity.

Limited generalization: Models often perform well on benchmark datasets but fail in real-world scenarios.
